[Jeet](http://jeet.gs) is the most advanced, yet intuitive, grid system on the market today.

By making use of the power of pre-processors, we can now pass real fractions (or float numbers) as context that generates a percentage based width and gutter for grids. We're able to do this while maintaining a consistently sized infinitely nestable gutter.

Check out [this presentation](http://corysimmons.github.io/presentations/the-rise-of-ratio-grids) to learn more about what sets Jeet above other grid systems, then enjoy one of Jeet's many pre-processor flavors:

- [Stylus](stylus)
- [SCSS](scss)

Want to sandbox it right this very second? Fork an [SCSS](http://bit.ly/jeet6-scss) or [Stylus](http://bit.ly/jeet6-stylus) example on CodePen.

Explore [Jeet Integrations](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet/wiki/Jeet-Integrations) to see some community-backed plugins to your favorite frameworks and libraries.

#### Browser Support
- IE9+ and all major browsers without polyfills like Selectivizr
- We've had reports that IE7 + 8 can be supported, but please **use at your own risk**. You will need [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com/) along with [a required library](http://selectivizr.com/#how). You may also want [Html5 Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) & [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond).

- If you would like to support older browsers, please use a tool like [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) or [Nib](https://github.com/tj/nib) to add the required browser prefixes.
